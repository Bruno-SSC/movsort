    connected and played around with the API to get a grasp of it.
com 1
    implemented the "movie_list" element which holds and presents the list of queried movies in cards
com 2
    started using sass, organized files structure into MVC, implemented a modal animation for selecting the year and working on the filters options.
com 3
    finished the modal behavior, added the changing color for selected filters, started working on updating the movie list on filter change
com 4
    refactoring some code to avoid macaroni code (particularly, working in a more "variable-directed" way of knowing the included filters and updating their states accordingly)
com 5
    I got a better code to handle open modals but I'm still working on it. Currenly, I'm thinking about wether I should close everyone not open and open them based on the new open list or change the data structure for modals and their state.
com 6
    reached a reasonable way to store the modal state.

    connected and played around with the API to get a grasp of it.
com 1
    implemented the "movie_list" element which holds and presents the list of queried movies in cards
com 2
    started using sass, organized files structure into MVC, implemented a modal animation for selecting the year and working on the filters options.
com 3
    finished the modal behavior, added the changing color for selected filters, started working on updating the movie list on filter change
com 4
    refactoring some code to avoid macaroni code (particularly, working in a more "variable-directed" way of knowing the included filters and updating their states accordingly)
com 5
    I got a better code to handle open modals but I'm still working on it. Currenly, I'm thinking about wether I should close everyone not open and open them based on the new open list or change the data structure for modals and their state.
com 6
    reached a reasonable way to store the modal state.
com 7
    updated view functions to work with the new structure of model states. Started working on the option states for inclusion/exclusion. Reached a "working" code but not sure if acceptable result.
com 8
    working on the updating the frontend accordingly to the options model but it's not turning out in a likeable way for me.
com 9
    I got the frontend updating properly for the options changing but now i'm trying to get an alternative way and it's not going well.

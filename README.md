## Briefing ğŸ“„

- This app consumes the TMDB API to show a list of movies. 
- Movies can be filtered by genre and year. 
- It's possible to search for a movie within the current filters based on it's name.
- There is two options for layout, grid and list. List has more details about each movie.
- The API provides multiple pages of 20 items for each request. Therefore, the app has multiple pages in the bottom.

## Alerts âš¡

- This project may not be optimized to your screen. I used 1920x1080 screen during development.
